Robert Lee-Cann is a Web Developer based in Suffolk, England. In his spare time
he is a prolific event organiser. As part of non-profit Geeks of London, he has
helped run [BarCamp London] for the past few years, as well as a number of hack
days, including [HACKED], a 500 person event at The O2 in London.

He survives mainly off tea, but is occasionally tempted away by a half-decent
cup of coffee.
